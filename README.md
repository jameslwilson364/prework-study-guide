# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## A guide for prework before the course.

- This project provided an opportunity to examine the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript and how they pertain to basic web development.
- I constructed this project as means to refresh my coding skills and add valuable notes for the start of a study guide for the UTSA coding bootcamp
- The study guide webpage provides a basic repository for notes pertaining to coding and git/github management
- I was already familiar with basic HTML and Javascript.  This project introduced me to CSS and employing the branch methodology for editing code.

## Installation

## Usage
 - One key for using the study guide is to ensure that the user opens the console in the browser.  We can do this in Chrome by right clicking anywhere on the page and selecting "inspect".  A convenient side bar will open and display all of the code behind the page.  There the user can change the tab of the side bar and select console.  Through the browser console the user can interact with the basic scripts that were built for the page.
